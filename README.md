# eveonlinetool
a tool to aid in the online marketplace to help the users find the cheapest buy and sell location in the eve universe.

$$ long term maybe provide some kind of route-setting to optimize route path from the users starting system.
***(may pick a stock system to start from or allow the user to select the starting system before the select the item or items they are looking for)


could be a situation where we try to see what trade hub has the highest and lowest buy sell orders.
--------------------
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
    * items
      location
      price
      distance          via api or esi (json xml) ?????? need to learn more about the topic

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
    * eve time clock and countdown before cluster wipe (happens at the end ove eveyday #downtime)

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
    * perhaps a starting system or trade hub
    * cycling through items.... maybe a count of 5 (depends on how crazy things get) [single selection] based on req1
    * also give the user an option to countinue or back out of the tool
    *** offer users to add items to cart for route optimization [multiple collection]

*********Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
    *populates via user selectiom in loop (if multiple)
    ** or populates via json/api
    *** need some elaboration this could be something that ties into optimizing a route by organizing the systems by light years away from eachother.
    ^^^ combined with user input to either select items via the master loop
            ^


seperate ui from the methods in a diff class that pertain to the code.
multiple files linked
input output data
searching and manipulation


what is link?
